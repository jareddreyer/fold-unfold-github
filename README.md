# GitHub Fold

Fold or Unfold all files in GitHub's compare view.

---

I like reviewing each file individually while in GitHub's compare view and having all files open and expanded all at once is distracting. _(also sometimes my browser gives up when the diffs are huge.)_

This extension adds buttons to fold or unfold all files at once.
